"""
An example of a Python script on how to resample all bands for 4 Sentinel satellite images
in parallel with Dask using several computing nodes in Puhti supercomputer

All the files are worked in parallel with the help of Dask delayed functions, see main()-function.
More info about Python Dask library can be found from:
https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/why.html
