"""
A simple example Python script how to calculate NDVI for three Sentinel satellite images
in parallel with the joblib library.

All the files are worked in parallel with the help of a joblib Parallel jobs, see main()-function.
More info about Python joblib library can be found from:
https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallel.html
