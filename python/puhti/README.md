# Python Puhti examples

Here are examples for running Python code on CSC's Puhti supercomputer as four different job styles: interactive, serial, array and embarrasingly/delightfully/naturally parellel. For parallel jobs there are 3 options with different Python libraries: `multiprocessing`, `joblib` and `dask`.  We'll take a look at these three and `GNUParallel`. The interactive style is best for developing your scripts, usually with limited test data. For computationally more demanding analysis you have to use Puhti's batch system for requesting the resources and running your scripts. 

## Example case

![](https://ece.montana.edu/seniordesign/archive/SP15/OpticalWeedMapping/uploads/4/9/2/7/49273335/1429843234.png)
From [ECE Montana](https://ece.montana.edu/seniordesign/archive/SP15/OpticalWeedMapping/ndvi.html)

The example calculates NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from Sentinel-2 satellite image's red and near infrared bands. The reading, writing and calculation of NDVI are identical in all examples (with the exception of the Dask - xarray example) and only the method of parallelization changes (the code in the main function). 

Basic idea behind the script is to:

- Find red and near infrared channels of Sentinel L2A product from its `SAFE` folder (to simplify, we will call this a Sentinel-2 file from here on) and open the `jp2` files. -> `readImage`
- Read the data as `numpy` array with `rasterio`, scale the values to reflectance values and calculate NDVI index. -> `calculateNDVI`
- Save output as GeoTiff with `rasterio`. -> `saveImage`

Files in this example:

* The input **ESA Sentinel L2A images** are in JPG2000 format and are already stored in Puhti: `/appl/data/geo/sentinel/s2_example_data/L2A`. Puhti has only these example images, more [Sentinel L2A images are available from CSC Allas](https://docs.csc.fi/data/datasets/spatial-data-in-csc-computing-env/#spatial-data-in-allas).
* The example scripts are in subfolders by job type and used parallel library. Each subfolder has 2 files:
    * A **.py** file for defining the tasks to be done.
    * A batch job **.sh** file for submitting the job to Puhti batch job scheduler (SLURM).

## Let's get started 


If you haven't yet, get the example scripts to Puhti:

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that you will need to adapt the paths mentioned in this material. In most cases it is `cscusername` and `project_200xxxx` that need to be replaced with your CSC username and your projectname.

* Log in to Puhti web interface: https://puhti.csc.fi
* Start a `Login node shell`
* Create a folder for yourself:
    * Switch to your projects scratch directory and further int the students directory: `cd /scratch/project_200xxxx/students` (fill in your project number for x)
    * Create new own folder:`mkdir cscusername` (replace cscusername with your username)
    * Switch into your own folder: `cd cscusername` (replace cscusername with your username)
    * Get the exercise material by cloning this repository: `git clone https://github.com/csc-training/geocomputing`
    * Switch to the directory with example files: `cd geocomputing/python/puhti`.
    * Check that we are in the correct place: `pwd` should show something like `/scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername/geocomputing/python/puhti`.
    
    
## Interactive job

Within an [interactive job](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/interactive-usage/) it is possible to edit the script in between test-runs; so this suits best when still writing the script. Usually it is best to use some smaller test dataset for this.

### Jupyter

If you want to start prototyping and testing in a Jupyter Notebook, you can start with an interactive Jupyter session. Choose **Jupyter** from the Puhti web interface dashboard or the Apps tab in the Puhti web interface. We can find one such prototype file for calculating the NDVI for one file in the materials called `interactive.py`. It introduces the packages and workflow for this lesson.

* Settings for Jupyter:
    * (Reservation: `geocomputing_fri`, only during course)
    * Project: `project_200xxxx`
    * Partition: `interactive` (`small` during course)
    * Number of CPU cores: 1
    * Memory: 3 Gb
    * Local disk: 0
    * Time: 1:00:00
    * Python: geoconda
    * Jupyter type: Lab (you can also try Notebook, based on needs and preferences)
    * Working directory: `/scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername`
    * `Launch`

* Wait a moment -> Connect to Jupyter
* Jupyter opens up in the browser
* Open folder with the exercise files from the left browser panel `/scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername/geocomputing/python/puhti` and find the file `interactive.ipynb`. Execute each code cell one after the other with `Shift+Enter`.

As mentioned, Jupyter is nice for prototyping and testing, however if we want to use this process as part of a larger script, or make it possible to more easily adapt the script to run on other files or calculate other vegetation indices, we need to generalize it and put the code in a Python script. This means for example to put parts into functions, so that they can be reused. You can find one such cleaned up and generalized script with much more comments in `00_interactive/interactive_single_core_example.py`. Let's take a look at it: 

### Interactive job with Python script

We can open and look at the Python script from Puhti webinterface > Files tab, within Jupyter environment, Visual Studio Code application or the command line. 

#### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code or VSCode is a source code editor by Microsoft. In addition to being able to run the full script within Visual Studio Code, it also possible to run parts of a script step by step.

* Start [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/webinterface/vscode/) in [Puhti web interface](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/webinterface/).
    * Open VSCode start page from front page: Apps -> Visual Studio code
    * Choose settings for VSCode:
        * (Reservation: `geocomputing_fri`, only during course)
        * Project: `project_200xxxx`
        * Partition: `interactive` (`small` during course)
        * Number of CPU cores: 1
        * Memory: 2 Gb
        * Local disk: 0
        * Time: 1:00:00
        * Code version and compiler: leave default
        * Modules: geoconda
        * `Launch`
    * Wait a moment -> Connect to Visual studio code
    * VSCode opens up in the browser
* Open folder with exercise files: 
    * Click three lines up left -> File -> Open folder -> `/scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername/geocomputing/python/puhti` -> OK
* Open [00_interactive/interactive_single_core_example.py](00_interactive/interactive_single_core_example.py). This is a Python script, which calculates NDVI for one input Sentinel-2 "file". 
* Check that needed Python libraries are available in Puhti:
    * Select all import rows and press `Shift+Enter`. Wait a few seconds. The import commands are run in Terminal (which opens automatically on the bottom of the page). If no error messages are visible, the packages are available. Also other parts of the script can be tested in the same manner (select the code and run with `Shift+Enter`).
* We can also run the full script by following these steps: 
    * Exit Python console in Terminal: type `exit()` in the terminal, if you ran pieces of the code before.
    * Click the arrow up right above script (Run Python File in Terminal)
    * Wait, it takes a few minutes for complete. The printouts will appear  in the terminal during the process. Note the time it took.
    * Check that there is one new GeoTiff file in your work directory in the Files panel of VSCode.
* Optional, check your results with [QGIS](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/qgis/)

#### Command line

If you prefer working in the command line, you can also start a compute node shell directly from the tools tab in Puhti web interface. Choose settings for the interactive session:

* Project: project_200xxxx
* Number of CPU cores: 1
* Memory: 2 Gb
* Local disk: 0
* Time: 1:00:00

> [!NOTE]
> You can also start an [interactive session](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/running/interactive-usage/) from a login node (by starting a login node shell from tools tab in Puhti webinterface or by connecting to Puhti via ssh in your own computers terminal) with:
>  `sinteractive --account project_200xxxx --cores 1 --time 02:00:00 --mem 4G --tmp 0` 
> This gives you a compute node shell; you can see "where" you are from your terminal prompt [cscusername@puhti-loginXX] -> login node, [cscusername@rXXcXX] (XX being some numbers) -> compute node. 

For both of the above:

After getting access to the compute node shell, you can load modules and run scripts "like on a normal linux computer":

>[!NOTE]
> Remember to change the project name and your CSC user name in the paths below.

```
module load geoconda
cd /scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername/geocomputing/python/puhti/00_interactive
python interactive_single_core_example.py 
```

* Wait, it takes a few minutes for complete. The printouts will appear  in the terminal during the process. Note the time it took.
* Check that there is one new GeoTiff file in your work directory with `ls -l output`
* Close the compute node shell tab in your browser and delete the running job from `my interactive sessions` in the Puhti webinterface.
* Optional, check your results with [QGIS](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/qgis/)


## Serial job

What if we don't want the execution of the script blocking our command line? We need to start writing batch job scripts and separate the submission of the job on the login node from the execution of the job on a compute node -> We go non-interactive. **From this point onwards we will have to work from the command line.**

* Open `/scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername/geocomputing/python/puhti/01_serial/single_core_example.sh` (replace your project number and CSC username in path) with your favorite editor (e.g. `nano` in login node shell or open the file editor via the three dots next to the filename in the webinterface -> Files section or VSCode).

* Check out the changes in the Python file compared to the `00_interactive/interactive_single_core_example.py`:
    * Python script reads one input image file from the argument, which is set inside the batch job file. 

> [!NOTE]
> Can you find out from the `.sh` file: 
> * Where are output and error messages written?
> * How many cores are reserved, and for how long a time? 
> * How much memory?
> * Which partition is used?
> * Which module is used?
> * Does this all sound familiar? Yes, we have given these parameters before, just in a different way.

* Update the project with the number of your project
* Submit the batch job from **login node shell** (not VSCode terminal or compute node shell):

>[!NOTE]
> Remember to change the project name and your CSC user name in the paths below.

```
cd /scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername/geocomputing/python/puhti/01_serial
sbatch single_core_example.sh
```

-> `sbatch` prints out a job ID

> [!NOTE]
> Use the job ID to check state and efficiency of the batch job with `seff jobid` (replace jobid with the job ID from the print out)
> Did you reserve a good amount of memory?


* Once the job is finished, see output in `slurm-jobid.out` and `slurm-jobid.err` (e.g. with `cat slurm-jobid.out`) for any possible errors and other outputs. 
* Check that you have a new GeoTiff file in the output folder.

### Running through multiple Sentinel-2 files

What if we want to run the same process for not only one, but all Sentinel-2 files within a folder? 

-> We could adapt the sbatch script to run the same script with different input one after another  in a for loop in the sbatch file, see `01_serial/single_core_example_list.sh` (the Python file stays the same as before). 

-> Or we adjust the Python script to take in the data folder instead of just one Sentinel-2 file and loop through all files in the main function (see `01_serial/single_core_example_folder.sh` and `01_serial/single_core_example_folder.py`). You can run it the same way as the single file script, by adapting the project to your project number in the `.sh` file.

## GNU parallel

GNU parallel can help parallelizing a script which otherwise is not parallelized. Instead of looping through the three files available within the batch job or the Python script, we let GNU Parallel handle that step. Checkout how it is used in [02_gnu_parallel/gnu_parallel_example.sh](02_gnu_parallel/gnu_parallel_example.sh) with your favorite editor and adapt the project number.

* Changes in the batch job file compared to the `01_serial/single_core_example_list.sh`:
    * `--cpus-per-task` parameter is used to reserve 3 CPUs for the job
    * Instead of a for loop, we use `parallel` program to read in the filenames from the text file and distribute them to the CPUs
    * Memory and time allocations


> To get to know how many `cpus-per-task` we need you can use for example `ls /appl/data/geo/sentinel/s2_example_data/L2A | wc -l` in the login node shell to count everything within the data directory before writing the batch job script. 

Submit the job to Puhti from login node shell:

>[!NOTE]
> Remember to change the project name and your CSC user name in the paths below.

```
cd /scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername/geocomputing/python/puhti/02_gnu_parallel
sbatch gnu_parallel_example.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> Check with `seff jobid`: How much time and resources did you use?

### Array job

In the array job example the idea is that the Python script will run one process for every given input file as opposed to running a for loop within the script or one job on multiple CPUs (GNU parallel). 

* [03_array/array_job_example.sh](03_array/array_job_example.sh) array job batch file. Changes compared to `01_serial/single_core_example_list.sh`:
    * `--array` parameter is used to tell how many jobs to start. Value 1-3 in this case means that `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` variable will be from 1 to 3. We can use `sed` to read the first three lines from our `image_path_list.txt` file and start a job for each input file. 
	* Output from each job is written to `slurm-jobid_arrayid.out` and `slurm-jobid_arrayid.err` files. 
	* Memory and time allocations are per job.

```
cd /scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername/geocomputing/python/puhti/03_array
sbatch array_job_example.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> Check with `seff`: How much time and resources did you use?


## Parallelization within Python

We can also paralellize within Python. In this case there is no for loop to process them one after another, but the Python code takes care of dividing the work to 3 processes running at the same time, one for each input file. Python has several packages for code parallelization, here examples for `multiprocessing` and `dask` are provided. `multiprocessing` package is likely the easiest to use and is included in all Python installations by default. Another Python package for parallelization is `joblib`. You can find code (without exercise) for `joblib` in `05_parallel_joblib`. `multiprocessing` and `joblib` are suitable for one node (max 40 cores). 

### Multiprocessing

* [04_parallel_multiprocessing/multiprocessing_example.sh](04_parallel_multiprocessing/multiprocessing_example.sh) batch job file for `multiprocessing`.
	* `--ntasks=1` + `--cpus-per-task=3` reserves 3 cores - one for each file
	* `--mem-per-cpu=2G` reserves memory per core

* [04_parallel_multiprocessing/multiprocessing_example.py](04_parallel_multiprocessing/multiprocessing_example.py)
	* Note how the pool of workers is started and processes divided to workers with `pool.map()`. This replaces the for loop that we have seen in `01_serial/single_core_example_folder.sh`.

```
cd /scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername/geocomputing/python/puhti/04_parallel_multiprocessing
sbatch multiprocessing_example.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> Check with `seff`: How much time and resources did you use?

### dask

`dask` is versatile and has several options for parallelization, this example is for single-node (max 40 cores)- usage, but `dask` can also be used for multi-node jobs. This example uses [delayed functions](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/delayed.html) from Dask to parallelize the workload. Typically, if a workflow contains a for-loop, it can benefit from delayed. [Dask delayed tutorial](https://tutorial.dask.org/03_dask.delayed.html)

* [06_parallel_dask/single_node/dask_singlenode.sh](06_parallel_dask/single_node/dask_singlenode.sh) batch job file for `dask`.
	* `--ntasks=1` + `--cpus-per-task=3` reserves 3 cores - one for each file
	* `--mem-per-cpu=2G` reserves memory per core

* [06_parallel_dask/single_node/dask_singlenode.py](06_parallel_dask/single_node/dask_singlenode.py)


> [!NOTE]
> Submit the parallel job to Puhti from login node shell

>[!NOTE]

```
cd /scratch/project_200xxxx/students/cscusername/geocomputing/python/puhti/06_parallel_dask/single_node
sbatch dask_singlenode.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> Check with `seff`: How much time and resources did you use?

Another example using xarray in addition to dask is provided in [06_parallel_dask/single_node/dask_singlenode_xr.sh](06_parallel_dask/single_node/dask_singlenode_xr.sh).

Check out also [CSC dask tutorial](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/dask-python/).
Dask can do so much more than delay function computation. Check out the [dask documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/) and for example [NCAR dask tutorial](https://ncar.github.io/dask-tutorial/README.html).

## Example benchmarks 

These are just to demonstrate the difference between single core vs. some kind of parallelism. Depending on the issue, some library might be faster or slower. Note also that the performance of your job may depend on some different factors, like disk load or network speed.

| Example         | Jobs | CPU cores / job | Time (min) | CPU efficiency |
|-----------------|------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| single core     | 1    | 1               | 02:29      | 86.70%         |
| GNU parallel    | 1    | 3               | 00:58      | 70.69%         |
| array job       | 3    | 1               | 01:03      | 85.71%         |
| multiprocessing | 1    | 3               | 00:52      | 80.13%         |
| dask            | 1    | 3               | 01:46      | 88.68%         |
