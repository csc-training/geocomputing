# Using CSC's Pouta platform for geocomputing applications
A collection of instructions to setup virtual machines in [CSC's cPouta environment](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/) for different tools:
- [GeoServer or OpenDroneMap as Docker applications](./docker_geoserver_or_opendronemap) - installing other Docker applications would be very similar.
- [MetaShape](./metashape_with_VNC)  - installing other Desktop tools could be rather similar.
- [ArcPy](./arcpy)
- Earlier also **PostGIS** was recommended to be installed to cPouta, now [Pukki](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/dbaas/) is more suitable for databases.
