Examples for doing spatial analysis with **R** in CSC computing environment:
* [puhti](puhti) - Calculating contour lines with `terra`, also in parallel with `snow`, `parallel` and `future`. Includes examples for different job types in Puhti: simple serial, array and parallel.
* [raster_predict](raster_predict) - Predicting precence/absence of some species using using `predict()` funcion from `raster` package. Some of the functions in `raster` package support parallel computing and `predict()` is one of these. Includes also the batch job (parallel) file for Puhti.
* [geopackage](geopackage)
* [using R with LiDAR data](R_LiDAR) - examples and exercises
