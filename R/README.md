Examples for doing spatial analysis with **R** in CSC computing environment:
* `contours` - Calculating contour lines with `RSAGA`, also in parallel with `snow`. Includes examples for different job types in Taito: simple serial, array and parallel. 
* `raster_predict` - Predicting precence/absence of some species using using `predict()` funcion from `raster` package. Some of the functions in `raster` packege support parallel computing and `predict()` is one of these. Includes also the batch job (parallel) file for Taito.
