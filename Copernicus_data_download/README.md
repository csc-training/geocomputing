# Downloading data from Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem

With the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) new ways of downloading data have been introduced. 

The script [CDSE_to_Allas_object_storage.sh](CDSE_to_Allas_object_storage.sh) provides an example on how to query and download CDSE with command line tools.

You can also use `boto3` with  Python, for which you can find an example here :[Python Allas S3 example](../python/allas/working_with_allas_from_Python_S3.py).

Check out the [CSC Earth Observation guide](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/gis/eo_guide) for further information about the CDSE.
