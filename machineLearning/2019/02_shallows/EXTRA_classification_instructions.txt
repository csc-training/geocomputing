#### INSTRUCTIONS

In this excercise you are supposed to choose one model from the previous classification excercise and train a new model with completely different data
This time the dataset is consisted of building footprints and aerial images opposed to the Sentinel satellite image and forest species used previously

Steps:

1. Change file paths to match the new data (training clip of an aerial image and the whole aerial image and the building labels)

2. Choose which model you want to use (random forest, gradient boost, Stochastic Gradient Decent)

3. Add import statement for that model to the top part of EXTRA_classification_template.py

4. Fill the model name and the model object to the main() function of EXTRA_classification_template.py

5. Run the model and inspect the results in QGIS. How well did it recognize buildings?

6. If there is time, try another model or try different parameters for the model. Possible parameters can be found in scikit-learn documentation
