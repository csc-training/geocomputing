# Noppe

CSC Noppe is a service for providing common easy-to-use exercise environment for courses. Noppe suppors currently Jupyter Lab/Notebooks and RStudio. Current log-in options are: CSC accounts, HAKA, Virtu and MOOC.fi.
It is possible to use existing Docker containers or, if you have special requirements, you can also create the docker containers yourself.
