# Notebooks 

CSC Noppe is a service for providing common easy-to-use exercise environment for courses. Noppe suppors currently Jupyter Lab/Notebooks and RStudio. Current log-in options are: CSC accounts, HAKA, Virtu and MOOC.fi.
It is possible to use existing Docker containers or, if you have special requirements, you can also create the docker containers yourself. This folder here contains Dockerfiles used for CSC and University of Helsingi GIS courses.
